## Notes

* See http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
* Here are some issues with making a change to a file online at GitHub:
  * To commit a change, you'll get a input for the commit title and a textarea for any additional details.
  * There is an alert that pops up when you go past 50 characters in the title, but shows nothing in the textarea.
  * These elements do not use a monospace font, nor do they show any indication as to where you should add a line break to maintain formatting
* This style was inspired by [this thread](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17) :heart: Linus
